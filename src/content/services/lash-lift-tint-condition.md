If you have lashes that seem to point downwards, are tired of curling your lashes daily, or are looking for a more natural look than lash extensions, this service is for you!
With proper aftercare, you can expect your natural lashes to stay gently curled for up to 4-8 weeks!

Maintenance appointments can be made no sooner than every 6 weeks to preserve your lash health.
Contact lenses must be removed before appointment.
Lash serum and tinting are available as add ons when provided with this service.
