This is a stand-alone service involving LED light therapyâ€”a painless, non-invasive treatment with no down time or UV light to increase circulation, improve skin texture and tone, kill acne causing bacteria, reduce inflammation, and accelerate the skin's healing process.
This service will include a double cleansing to thoroughly remove any product or excess oil and dead skin to ensure light absorption, and application of a peptide-rich moisturizer to top off the benefits.

Enzo Glow proudly uses the clinically proven and Class II OTC medical device from Celluma for this service and other facial services as an add on when determined to be appropriate.
